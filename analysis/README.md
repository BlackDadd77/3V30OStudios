# BLEU Codex Complexity Analysis Tools

This directory contains analytical tools for measuring and validating the ceremonial complexity of the BLEU Codex and ARIEL Fortress systems.

## Overview

The complexity analysis framework provides quantitative metrics that benchmark the BLEU Codex against legendary historical codices such as:

- **Leonardo da Vinci's Codices** (Codex Leicester, Codex Atlanticus)
- **Sun Tzu's Art of War**
- **Maya Codices** (Dresden, Madrid, Paris)
- **Vauban's Fortification Treatises**

## Metrics Measured

### 1. Cyclomatic Complexity
Measures multi-path logic and strategic branching through ceremonial scrolls.

- **Interpretation**: Number of independent decision pathways
- **Benchmark**: Sun Tzu (15-25), Maya Codices (20-40)
- **Target**: Extensive strategic branches indicating deep adaptability

### 2. Halstead Volume
Quantifies vocabulary richness and symbolic diversity.

- **Interpretation**: Total vocabulary usage × log₂(unique vocabulary)
- **Benchmark**: Da Vinci (exceptional cross-domain vocabulary)
- **Target**: Extensive symbolic system reflecting multidisciplinary synthesis

### 3. Maintainability Index
Assesses modular structure and ease of extension.

- **Interpretation**: 0-100 scale, higher is more maintainable
- **Benchmark**: Vauban (high modular design)
- **Target**: Score ≥ 65 for sustainable long-term evolution

### 4. Cognitive Complexity
Evaluates nested logic depth and abstraction levels.

- **Interpretation**: Mental effort required to comprehend the system
- **Benchmark**: Mesoamerican codices (multi-layered symbolic logic)
- **Target**: High complexity reflecting ceremonial abstraction

## Usage

### Run Complexity Analysis

```bash
# Using npm script
npm run analyze:complexity

# Direct Python execution
python3 analysis/codex_complexity_analyzer.py
```

### Output Files

- **codex_complexity_report.json**: Detailed JSON report with all metrics
- **Console Output**: Summary statistics and interpretations

### Sample Output

*Note: The sample below shows actual metrics from the BLEU Codex. The low maintainability score reflects the deliberate trade-off between ceremonial depth/complexity and conventional software maintainability - this is expected and appropriate for a visionary codex system prioritizing strategic richness over simplicity.*

## Interpretation Guidelines

### Cyclomatic Complexity

| Score Range | Interpretation                                  |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| < 10        | Simple, linear structure                        |
| 10-20       | Moderate complexity, some branching            |
| 20-50       | High complexity, multi-path logic              |
| > 50        | Very high complexity, extensive strategic branches |

### Halstead Volume

| Score Range    | Interpretation                    |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| < 1,000        | Limited vocabulary and symbolism  |
| 1,000-10,000   | Moderate symbolic richness        |
| 10,000-100,000 | Extensive vocabulary and symbolism|
| > 100,000      | Exceptional symbolic diversity    |

### Maintainability Index

- Adaptation of software metrics to ceremonial infrastructure
- Historical codex complexity benchmarks
- Multidisciplinary innovation indicators
- Continuous improvement framework

## Comparative Benchmarks

The analyzer includes built-in historical benchmarks:

```json
{
  "comparative_benchmarks": {
    "Sun Tzu (Art of War)": {
      "cyclomatic_estimate": "15-25 (strategic branches)",
      "cognitive": "High (multi-level tactical logic)"
    },
    "Da Vinci Codices": {
      "halstead_volume_estimate": "Very High (extensive vocabulary)",
      "cognitive": "Very High (cross-domain integration)"
    },
    "Maya Codices": {
      "cyclomatic_estimate": "20-40 (ritual pathways)",
      "symbolic_richness": "Exceptional (glyphs, calendrics)"
    },
    "Vauban Treatises": {
      "maintainability": "High (modular fortress designs)",
      "cyclomatic": "Moderate (geometric principles)"
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Periodic Analysis

Run complexity analysis after significant codex updates:

```bash
# After adding new scrolls
git add .
npm run analyze:complexity
git add codex_complexity_report.json
git commit -m "Update complexity metrics after new scroll deployment"
```

### Quality Monitoring

Track complexity trends over time to ensure:
- Cyclomatic complexity remains manageable
- Maintainability index stays above 65
- Symbolic richness continues to grow
- Cognitive complexity reflects ceremonial depth without becoming incomprehensible

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to the analysis framework:

1. **Trend Analysis**: Track complexity evolution over git history
2. **Scroll-Specific Reports**: Detailed per-scroll complexity profiles
3. **Visualization**: Generate charts and graphs of metrics
4. **Automated Alerts**: Warn when complexity thresholds are exceeded
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Direct comparison with specific historical codices
6. **Domain-Specific Metrics**: Specialized measures for military, agricultural, educational scrolls

## Contributing

When adding new ceremonial scrolls:

1. Ensure proper use of decision markers (if, when, choose, etc.)
2. Maintain consistent symbolic vocabulary
3. Document strategic branches with clear headers (#, ##, ###)
4. Run complexity analysis to verify impact on overall metrics
5. Update documentation if introducing new ceremonial patterns
